# FLSUN V400 Cura Printer Profiles

The profiles in this repository are intended for a FLSun V400 3D printer, that have been flashed over to the
official version of Klipper. It may be incompatible with the modified FLSun version of Klipper!

Inspiration of profiles has been taken from [phnxdrgn536]. Thank you for your work!
They have been modified and simplified (e.g. some materials and intents were omitted).

An install script ([install.sh](install.sh)) has been added to support installation on linux.
